    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "I'm Hansal Bhangale, a Software Engineering student at the University of Mumbai, passionate about the intersection of Data Science, AI, and Financial Modelling. With a strong foundation in both tech and finance—backed by a CFA Level 1 certification—I enjoy solving real-world problems through data-driven, scalable solutions.\n\nI’ve worked on diverse projects from quantum computing and LSTM-based forecasting to financial sentiment analysis and supply chain optimization. My experience includes developing advanced algorithms at CybraneX Technologies, building AI dashboards with Streamlit, and working with technologies like LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS. I'm always eager to learn, experiment, and create impact through intelligent systems.\n\n"
